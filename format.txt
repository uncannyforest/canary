======================== FORMAT VERSION 1.3 ========================

============
FIRST COLUMN
============
The first column has two non-black pixels.  (Below, V refers to vertical position.)

The topmost non-black pixel
V last row of percussion
R format version number, two 4-bit components (i.e. version 1.3 is 0x13)
G this plus 240 is the tempo, beats per minute
B pixels per beat

The second non-black pixel
V base note (major scale)
R volume (0-255)
G transpose from A440 (in 5 cents)

NOTES
=====

The green channel specifies a number of things.

??------
The first two bits specify sharps and flats.
00 double flat
01 flat
10 natural
11 sharp

--?-----
The third bit is unused.

---?????
The last five bits specify chirps and envelope.  If the first of these bits is 0, it specifies envelope; if 1, it specifies chirps.

---0???? envelopes
0000 none
0111 fade in quickly in proportion to frequency (to eliminate clicks)
1000 fade in and out quickly in proportion to frequency (to eliminate clicks)
1111 fade out quickly in proportion to frequency (to eliminate clicks)
0001-0110 decrease by 2^this power
1001-1110 increase by 2^(1111-this power)

---10??? start chirp
000 entire pixel
001-011 reach end by (1/2)^x of pixel
100-111 don't start until (1/2)^1000-x from end

---11??- end chirp
first bit ? reverse : don't reverse
second bit ? FILO : FIFO
- final bit unused
