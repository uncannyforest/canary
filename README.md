# Clockwork Canary

This app was initially a college project.  It reads from .png files using a certain format to specify synthesized music, and plays that
music.  The .png files can be written using MS Paint, GIMP, etc.  Whenever I think about making my own UI to *write* the files, I realize,
*MS Paint+GIMP already have all the functionality I needâ€”why duplicate that?*  There are plenty of other good apps out there that are more
user-friendly, but I actually find this pretty useful for my own music, which is why I continue to maintain and develop it.
